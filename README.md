This project allowed us to explore the factors influencing the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and determine to what extent intelligence is the result of genetic (innate) or environmental (acquired) factors. We defined the axes of analysis and carried out the various stages of data analysis. Our implementations and experiments mainly integrate four families of models: Classification, Clustering, Linear Regression, and Time Series models. Additionally, we enriched this project with a graphical interface (Website using Streamlit) and deployed it using Docker.
